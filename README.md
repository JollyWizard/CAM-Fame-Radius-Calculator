# CAM-Fame-Radius-Calculator

### Overview

This is a quick project I did regarding a common napkin calculation when setting up CAM mills from CAD drawings.

Depending on the drawing and tool setup, you will often have either a midpoint or edgepoint where the other is needed
At that point, you have to calculate an offset based on the tool radius.
Directionality can also be confusing.

This calculator gives you all for offset corners.
It is left to the user to read the orientation and choose the one they need.
The advantage is that manual calculations are avoided, and derived immediately from inputs..

The project was done in HTML5 without libraries. 
Layout still needs to be figured out.

Current status: First Draft.
